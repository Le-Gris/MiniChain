Lots of jobs. \nIn fact\u2014our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \nthan ever before in the history of America. \nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn\u2019t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \nWe won\u2019t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don\u2019t fix that. \nThat\u2019s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2014the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \nWe\u2019re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \nWe\u2019re going to have an infrastructure decade. \nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world\u2014particularly with China.  \nAs I\u2019ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \nWe\u2019ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \nAnd we\u2019ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \nWe\u2019ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes\u2014so every child\u2014and every American\u2014has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American\u2014urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \n4,000 projects have already been announced. \nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America \u2013 we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \nThere\u2019s been a law on the books for almost a century \nto make sure taxpayers\u2019 dollars support American jobs and businesses. \nEvery Administration says they\u2019ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \nThat\u2019s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \nLet me give you one example of why it\u2019s so important to pass it. \nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you\u2019ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \nIt won\u2019t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you\u2019ll see a \u201cField of dreams,\u201d the ground on which America\u2019s future will be built. \nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor \u201cmega site\u201d. \nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that po\"\n\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY:", "action_status": "started", "timestamp": 1677263001.3376486, "task_uuid": "20a1ac3f-edea-4723-9ac7-8c0243260035", "action_type": "Prompted", "task_level": [3, 1]}

Send it to my desk. I\u2019ll sign it.  \nAnd we will really take off. \nAnd Intel is not alone. \nThere\u2019s something happening in America. \nJust look around and you\u2019ll see an amazing story. \nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products \u201cMade In America.\u201d The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \nThat\u2019s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \nGM is making the largest investment in its history\u2014$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \nPowered by people I\u2019ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight. \nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u201cRust Belt.\u201d \nIt\u2019s time. \nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \nI get it. That\u2019s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \nLook at cars. \nLast year, there weren\u2019t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \nSo\u2014we have a choice. \nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \nLower your costs, not your wages. \nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let\u2019s make it in America. \nEconomists call it \u201cincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.\u201d \nI call it building a better America. \nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here\u2019s the plan: \nFirst \u2013 cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua\u2019s mom. \nImagine what it\u2019s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you\u2019re going to pay for it.  \nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \nDrug companies will still do very well.
